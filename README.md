## Illustrations using svg

  After learning a bit about photoshop, illustrator and other design tools I felt that a lot of effort is spent into creating visuals that are mostly static and non-interactive. As a developer it is unacceptable to spend so much time into learning a tool that barely expands my efficiency. 

  This project is my attempt to combine the power of svg (and modern browsers) and the versatility of programming to create art that is both interactive and reusable.

### Note: 
  - HTML canvas is much more efficient than svg. I prefer svg for it's ease.
